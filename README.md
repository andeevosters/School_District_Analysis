# School_District_Analysis
Our clients, Maria, is a data engineer for an undisclosed school district, and she is tasked with preparing all test data for analysis, reporting and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. Weâ€™re helping Maria on student funding and student test scores, using math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. We are specifically being asked to aggregate the data and show trends on school performance, so that the superintendent and school board can make decisions on school budgets and priorities.
